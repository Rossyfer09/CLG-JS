       <div id="encanto"><p>On May 17, 2022, a precious little angel was born. And on July 16th, after showing us that she was the most playful and cutest of all the options, she came home with us and we couldn't be happier. We don't have words to describe how many challenges, love and joy she has brought into our lives. She's a busy little bugger, always making noise, trying to get your food and seeking attention, but somehow she's just perfect. She's made mummy start going on walks up to twice a day, even in the rain and made mummy buy a car, and overcome the fear of driving after a car accident and also she was with mummy while she was learning how to do this website. </p>
